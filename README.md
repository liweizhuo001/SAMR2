Description: SAMR (Semi-Automatic Mmapping Revision) is a graph-based tool for interactive mapping revision. We equip it with partially automatized process to reduce the effort of manual evaluation.

## 1. Introductionï¼š
In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for interactive mapping revision with the purpose of reducing manual efforts as much as possible. 
DL-Lite ontologies and their mappings are encoded into an integrated graph, where its mapping arcs will be judged by the experts. We define the decision space for mapping revision, which can be used to improve the efficiency of manual decisions. After a manual decision is made in each interaction, the mapping arcs in the graph will be updated automatically. 
Moreover, we define an impact function based on the integrated graph and weights of mappings to identify the most influential mappings that will be displayed to experts. In this way, the efforts of manual decisions could be reduced further. 
To cope with the practicality of our method for alignments of large-scale ontologies,
we introduce the notion of "reliable" mappings in an attempt to alleviate the burden of experts for making decisions, and propose two soft principles to ensure the reliability of selected mappings.
In addition, we define an influence relation and propose a corresponding algorithm to enhance the method for detecting incoherence of the integrated graph, which are transformed from the ontologies beyond DL-Lite and their mappings.



## 2. Usage:
### Software:
Java 1.7 or higher. Hardware: 8GB RAM or more. 

### Data sets:
Ontologies of Conference Track, Anatomy Track and Large BioMed Track from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative ([OAEI](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/)) .

Alignments of HMatch and ASMOV in alignment4Experiment file are provided for Conference Track. 
Alignments of AROMA, FCA-Map, LogMapLite and AML-Map are provided for Anatomy Track and Large BioMed Track. You can find them in the directory of testdata/mappings.

### Operation:
a) If you install Eclipse, you can import this project directly and run the aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch.java or aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV.java. 
You can also manually adjust other methods by function "repairByGraph()" in aml.AML (line 905-927)  such as One2OneRevisedMappings(),ChristianToolRevisedMappings() and so on.

b) In order to provide better interactive services, we also provide a web version, call "[SAOR](https://github.com/liweizhuo001/SAOR)". You can directly download it and follow the its instruction to complete the matching repair. 

c) For automated repair by reference alignment, we can run the aml.RepairingByGraphAutoHMatch.java or aml.RepairingByGraphAutoASMOV.java. We also provide optional function about realible mappings in aml.AML (line 911), which can save 10%-35% for alignments generated by large ontologies. Moreover, there exists one varibale about error_user in the method called AutoBasedReferenceAlignmentSimpleAutoGraphRepair, which is used to test automated evaluation with error rate.

The key functions introduction:
aml.Repairingcmd.java: call SAMR interactive mapping revision. 
aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch.java: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by HMatch interactively. 
aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV.java: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by ASMOV interactively. 
aml.RepairingByGraphAutoHMatch.java call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by HMatch automatically. 
aml.RepairingByGraphAutoASMOV.java call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by ASMOV automatically.
